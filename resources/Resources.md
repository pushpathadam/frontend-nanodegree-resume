# Resources

## Books: 
- Jon Duckett’s HTML&CSS and 
- JavaScript& Jquery are alway by my desk.

## Online reference: 
- w3schools.com is great for checking syntax quickly
- stackoverflow.com for stickier issues
- google maps documentation to customize the colors etc.

## Frameworks I looked at
I looked at several front-end frameworks to handle resonsiveness and a different layout. These included
- Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/
- Foundation: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/index.html
- Skeleton: http://getskeleton.com/
- UiKit: http://getuikit.com/
- Pure: http://purecss.io/start/ 

Bootstrap and Foundation looked like overkill for this project. Skeleton and UiKit looked like I would need SASS or LESS to accomplish my goals. 
Pure looked manageable, and compact enough to understand quickly and modify.

## Other Resources
Besides Pure, I also used font-awesome and google fonts to achieve the final look.


## Concept Deliberations
### Javascript. Where does it fit in.
If HTML is the content layer, and CSS is the presentation layer, JavaScript can be considered the behavior layer. It can change how the page behaves interactively, modifying both the content presented and the presentation much more comprehensively than just HTML and CSS in combo.

### Function Use
Advantage to using function over spaghetti code.
Functions group statements to perform a specific task. Some advantages include:
- If the task is repeated, we can reuse the same code. 
- It can help manage variable scope so code doesn’t affect areas outside the function’s task by accident.
- It keeps the code well organized and self-contained for maintainability

### Api’s
What is an API, why is it important.
Its a series of public hooks or functions in an application, that let others access it in their own websites. It limits access in a predictable way. I’m will try the google maps api. On the fence on what else I’ll try.
